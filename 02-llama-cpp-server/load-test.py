You are a model-serving expert. Below is documentation about KV cache memory layouts:
PagedAttention (vLLM, 2023) treats the KV cache like virtual-memory pages so that
sequences don't need a contiguous physical block. Before it, ~60-80% of GPU memory
was wasted on internal fragmentation when sequences had variable length. RadixAttention
(SGLang, 2024) extends this idea by storing the KV cache in a radix tree keyed by
token sequence, so a cache hit on a shared prefix lets the engine skip prefill
entirely. vLLM v1 (Jan 2025) ships Automatic Prefix Caching (APC) on by default and
unifies the memory pool used for activations and KV. Disaggregated prefill/decode
(Mooncake, llm-d, NVIDIA Dynamo, 2025) runs the prefill phase on a dedicated GPU
pool and streams the resulting KV across NVLink/InfiniBand to a separate decode pool,
because prefill is compute-bound and decode is memory-bandwidth-bound and contend on
the same GPU when colocated.
